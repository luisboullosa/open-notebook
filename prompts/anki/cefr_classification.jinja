- Literary and specialized academic terms
- Nuanced native-level expressions
- Examples: veelomvattend, onontbeerlijk, epistemologisch

# CLASSIFICATION TASK

Analyze the following Dutch text and determine its CEFR level.

**Text to classify:**
{{ text }}

{% if word_frequency %}
# WORD FREQUENCY DATA

The following word frequency information is available (rank: 1 = most common):
{{ word_frequency }}

**Frequency Guidelines:**
- Rank 1-500: Likely A1-A2
- Rank 501-2000: Likely A2-B1
- Rank 2001-5000: Likely B1-B2
- Rank 5001-10000: Likely B2-C1
- Rank 10000+: Likely C1-C2
{% endif %}

{% if context_from_sources %}
# REFERENCE CONTEXT

The following information from CEFR reference materials may help with classification:

{{ context_from_sources }}
{% endif %}

# ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

Please provide:

1. **CEFR Level**: The most appropriate level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, or C2)
2. **Confidence**: Your confidence in this classification (0.0 to 1.0)
3. **Reasoning**: Explain your classification, considering:
   - Vocabulary complexity
   - Grammatical structures
   - Word frequency (if provided)
   - Context and usage
   - Comparison to reference materials (if provided)

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Return your analysis as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "level": "B1",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "This phrase uses common intermediate vocabulary related to work situations. The word frequency data shows these words rank between 1000-3000, typical for B1 level. The grammatical structure is straightforward but not overly simple."
}
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Only return the JSON object, no additional text
- Be consistent and objective in your classification
- If the text contains multiple difficulty levels, classify based on the most complex elements
- Consider the context: isolated words vs. phrases vs. full sentences
- Dutch-specific considerations: compound words, diminutives, and Dutch idioms
