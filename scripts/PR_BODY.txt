## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [x] Documentation update
- [x] Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] Test coverage improvement
- [ ] Performance improvement

## How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Tested locally with Docker
- [x] Tested locally with development setup
- [x] Added new unit tests (dev-only test harness/scripts)
- [ ] Existing tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- [x] Manual testing performed

**Test Details:**
- Generated a short WAV and exercised Whisper `/detect-language` and `/asr` endpoints.
- Ran `POST /api/sources/{source_id}/generate-anki-b2` on sample source `source:smnytv2llmk77i2mzrxj` and confirmed insight `source_insight:unxx5sprpdlveiad8box` with 19 cards.
- Verified TTS audio files were produced under `notebook_data/uploads/anki_data/audio/` using the Piper HTTP proxy and Wyoming/TCP fallback.

## Design Alignment

**Which design principles does this PR support?** (See [DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md](../DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md))

- [ ] Privacy First
- [x] Simplicity Over Features
- [x] API-First Architecture
- [x] Multi-Provider Flexibility
- [x] Extensibility Through Standards
- [x] Async-First for Performance

**Explanation:**
The PR tightens the transformation output contract (JSON), adds STT autodetect with a Dutch default, and provides TTS fallbacks so dev workflows remain resilient across providers and runtimes.

## Additional Context

- Dev/test artifacts were moved to `scripts/archived/` for easier follow-up cleanup. Large binaries remain archived until you confirm deletion or external backup.
- Image caching requires API keys and was not executed; follow-up PR recommended to persist media paths into insights.
